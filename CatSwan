   "description":"Art teacher Hase Hotaru is confounded by one of her students, Nekome Yuna. Yuna fell in love at first sight with Shiratori Ako, a contract teacher at the same school, and she cannot do anything but pursue her. However, Ako has a quirk, the depths of which are yet unknown. A student hopelessly in love and the adults around her being yanked around. A new and vibrant work by Yodokawa that plays out with the school as the stage! ",
